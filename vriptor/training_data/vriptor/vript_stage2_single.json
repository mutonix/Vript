        "a": "The clip takes place in an open, sunlit virtual landscape within the game 'Rust'. The first-person viewpoint suggests we are seeing through the eyes of the player character, who is traversing a grassy field with yellow flowers. In the background, there are boulders, trees, and distant mountains under a clear blue sky. The player is armed with what appears to be a rock, held in the right hand side of the frame. Text chat is visible on the screen, indicating multiplayer interaction. As the player moves forward, they comment on hearing a gunshot and suspect it's their friend. They express intent to find and show another 'zombie' to the viewers. Towards the end of the clip, a zombie is spotted down a road and the player moves towards it with the purpose of demonstrating how to kill it."
