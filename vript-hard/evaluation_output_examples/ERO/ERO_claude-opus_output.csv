Scene (C) shows the Monster Jam event taking place at night in an outdoor stadium with monster trucks racing and pyrotechnics going off. This likely occurs first chronologically.

Scene (A) depicts two people having a conversation while seated in the stadium stands during the daytime Monster Jam event. The outdoor daytime setting suggests this scene follows the nighttime event in Scene (C).

Finally, Scene (B) shows the subject in a hotel room in the evening discussing meeting up with viewers the next morning in Las Vegas, presumably after the Monster Jam event has concluded. The indoor nighttime hotel setting implies this scene occurs last in the sequence after the daytime stadium scene.

Scene (B) -> Scene (C) -> Scene (A)

Scene (B) shows the person rolling out and shaping the dough on the kitchen counter, which would be an initial step in the baking process. 

Scene (C) then depicts the presenter holding up the recipe book titled ""KID PIES"" with the shaped dough balls visible on the counter in front of her, suggesting this Scene (C)omes after the dough preparation in Scene (B).

Finally, Scene (A) shows the dough balls being placed into the preheated oven to bake until golden brown, which would be the final step after the dough is prepared and shaped in the earlier scenes.

So in summary, the logical order of the baking process shown is:
Dough preparation (Scene (B)), then presenting the recipe (Scene (C)), and finally baking the prepared dough (Scene (A))."
